- some basic commands in jupyterlab e.g. SHIFT ENTER
- about our crosscompute panel
- basic info about config file
- auto refresh
- possible ideas:
   - option 1: modifying an existing example
   - option 2: creating an automation from scratch

2 *** variables --- input, output, debug, log or how to design your automation from scratch

3 *** CORE: scripts or how to tell crosscompute how to run your script
command -- any programming language or executable
path: python script
path: python notebook
function: function in python

3 *** batches vs results/runs folder OR how to use the results/runs folder to debug while developing/creating/making your automations with the framework

4 *** CORE: how to make custom markdown templates
input

5 *** styles
general styles
style via view name _map _pdf
style via variable id
using regular expressions in your styles for cleaner syntax
external style files via uri

6 *** pages
how to configure what shows by default when you visit an automation page

7 *** how to make a step by step wizard using template expressions

8 *** example tutorial: how to specify dependencies that should be installed that are needed by your script (might be part of scripts)
example tutorial: when your script requires environment variables
linked to future platform feature of custom environment variables linked to a user profile

9 *** example tutorial: how to set a recurring run schedule for your script OR how to make a dashboard that updates itself
pycon conference automation

e.g. map-mapbox or how to show maps in your automations

11 *** e.g. view=link or how to let users download files that were generated by your script
how to set hardcoded link text and file name
how to do dynamically via configuration.path

12 *** e.g. radio view / checkbox
how to set radio options in config file
how to set radio options dynamically in an dynamic form
via path

13 *** example tutorial: making sure your scripts run in a podman container (and thus is compatible with platform)
environment.engine
environment.image

14 *** how to configure pdf reports using the print section
