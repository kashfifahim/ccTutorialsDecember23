# Auto Refresh in Tool Development and Reporting Automation

At CrossCompute we want our tools to deliver a efficient experience to all our users.  One of the key features of our framework geared towards significantly boosting productivity is the power of auto-refresh.  Auto-refresh, as the name suggests, is a functionality that automatically updates the document or page when changes are detected.  In this article let's delve into the three primary instances where auto-refresh can speed up your tool development and report automation: updates to configuration files, changes to your script, and modifications to your templates or styles.

## Updates to Configuration Files
As we have seen in earlier articles, the configuration file serves as the backbone of your tool.  Within our automate.yml file we set the names of our tool, indicate versions, define our tool's inputs and outputs, specify presets, list the needed datasets, specify the path to the script, as well as configure how the results are displayed.  Auto-refresh on CrossCompute is programmed to detect modifications to the configuration file.  This ensures that the latest settings are always in use, saving creators from constantly restarting or reloading their application, leading to a more streamlined workflow.

## Changes To Your Script
During development, our scripts are always undergoing changes. Every change, from bug fixes to the addition of new features, requires testing and validation. Auto-refresh can play a vital role here by automatically reloading the script whenever an update is made. This immediate feedback loop allows developers and report authors to see the impacts of their changes instantly, facilitating a more dynamic and responsive development process. 

## Modifying Your Templates or Styles
n the context of report automation and tool development, templates and styles dictate the appearance and layout of the output. Changes to these elements are common and with auto-refresh, any alterations to templates or styles are immediately reflected in the application or report. This feature is particularly beneficial for designers and front-end developers, as it allows them to see how their changes affect the overall look and feel in real-time.

## Embracing Auto-Refresh in Practice
Now that we've explored the key instances where auto-refresh can enhance the development and automation process, it's time to check out this feature in action.
